# Benchmarks

These benchmarks check that clip-for-fun is at least as fast as the great wl-clipboard, which is already plenty fast for all practical intents and purposes.

Median times and memory measured with [`bench/bench.sh`](bench/bench.sh), which compares clip-for-fun directly against wl-clipboard by running both with [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) against a private headless sway. Every row is the same behavior in both tools: copies offer the same five text types without type detection, and each paste reads from the same tool's copy.

| Copy a 29 B text argument<br>`clip-for-fun-copy <text>`<br>`wl-copy <text>` | 2.10 ms | 2.31 ms | 0.9 MiB | 0.6 MiB |
| Copy 40 B from stdin<br>`clip-for-fun-copy`<br>`wl-copy -t text/plain` | 2.08 ms | 3.74 ms | 0.9 MiB | 0.6 MiB |
| Copy 100 MiB from stdin<br>`clip-for-fun-copy`<br>`wl-copy -t text/plain` | 31.61 ms | 33.71 ms | 1.0 MiB | 0.6 MiB |

| Paste 100 MiB to `/dev/null`<br>`clip-for-fun-paste -t text/plain`<br>`wl-paste -n -t text/plain` | 2.59 ms | 4.59 ms | 1.9 MiB | 3.6 MiB |

Memory is resident memory (RSS). For copies it is the background process that keeps the copy available until the next copy; for pastes it is the median peak of 5 runs, and for wl-paste, which runs `cat`, the larger of the two processes.

100 runs per case (20 for 100 MiB) on an Intel Core i9-14900HX pinned to its performance cores, Linux 7.2.8, sway 1.12, wl-clipboard 2.3.0, hyperfine 1.20.0.

To reproduce, install sway 1.11+, wl-clipboard, hyperfine and GNU time, then run `bench/bench.sh`, pinned to fast cores with `taskset` on hybrid CPUs (`taskset -c 0-15 bench/bench.sh` here). `bench/bench.sh --help` lists the options, including `--compositor host` to use the running compositor.
